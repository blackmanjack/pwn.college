## Resuming Process

Usually, when you suspend processes, you'll want to resume them at some point. Otherwise, why not just terminate them? To resume processes, your shell provides the fg command, a builtin that takes the suspended process, resumes it, and puts it back in the foreground of your terminal.

Go try it out! This challenge's run needs you to suspend it, then resume it. Good luck!
