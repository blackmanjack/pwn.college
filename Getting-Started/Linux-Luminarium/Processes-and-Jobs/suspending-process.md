## Suspending Process

You have learned to interrupt processes with Ctrl-C, but there are less drastic measures you can use to get your terminal back! You can suspend processes to the background with Ctrl-Z. In this level, we'll explore how this works and, in the next level, we'll figure out how to resume those suspended processes!

## Solution

Ctrl+Z
