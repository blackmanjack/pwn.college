## Backgrounding Process

You've resumed processes in the foreground with the fg command. You can also resume processes in the background with the bg command! This will allow the process to keep running, while giving you your shell back to invoke more commands in the meantime.

This level's run wants to see another copy of itself running, not suspended, and using the same terminal. How? Use the terminal to launch it, then suspend it, then background it with bg and launch another copy while the first is running in the background!

ARCANUM: If you're interested in some deeper details, check out how to view the differences between suspended and backgrounded properties! Allow me to demonstrate. First, let's suspend a sleep:

```
hacker@dojo:~$ sleep 1337
^Z
[1]+ Stopped sleep 1337
hacker@dojo:~$
```

The sleep process is now suspended in the background. We can see this with ps by enabling the stat column output with the -o option:

```
hacker@dojo:~$ ps -o user,pid,stat,cmd
USER PID STAT CMD
hacker 702 Ss bash
hacker 762 T sleep 1337
hacker 782 R+ ps -o user,pid,stat,cmd
hacker@dojo:~$
```

See that T? That means that the process is suspended due to our Ctrl-Z. The S in bash's STAT column means that bash is sleeping while waiting for input. the R in ps's column means that it's actively running, and the + means that it's in the foreground!

Watch what happens when we resume sleep in the background:

hacker@dojo:~$ bg
[1]+ sleep 1337 &
hacker@dojo:~$ ps -o user,pid,stat,cmd
USER PID STAT CMD
hacker 702 Ss bash
hacker 762 S sleep 1337
hacker 1224 R+ ps -o user,pid,stat,cmd
hacker@dojo:~$
Boom! The sleep now has an S. It's sleeping while, well, sleeping, but it's not suspended! It's also in the background and thus doesn't have the +.

## Solution

Ctrl+Z
bg
